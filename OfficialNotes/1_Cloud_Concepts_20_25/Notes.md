# Identify the benefits and considerations of using cloud services

## Identify the benefits of cloud computing, such as High Availability, Scalability, Elasticity,Agility, and Disaster Recovery

- **High availability** : Depending on the service-level agreement (SLA) that you choose, your cloud-based apps can provide 
  a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong.
- **Scalability** : Apps in the cloud can scale vertically and horizontally:
    Scale vertically to increase compute capacity by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine.
    Scaling horizontally increases compute capacity by adding instances of resources, 
    such as adding VMs to the configuration.
- **Elasticity** : You can configure cloud-based apps to take advantage of autoscaling, so your apps always have 
   the resources they need.
- **Agility** : Deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as your app requirements change.
- **Geo-distribution** : You can deploy apps and data to regional datacenters around the globe, thereby ensuring that 
  your customers always have the best performance in their region.
- **Disaster recovery** : By taking advantage of cloud-based backup services, data replication, and geo-distribution, 
  you can deploy your apps with the confidence that comes from knowing that your data is safe in the event of disaster.


## Identify the differences between Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx)

- **Capital Expenditure (CapEx)** is the up-front spending of money on physical infrastructure, and then deducting that up-front expense over time. The up-front cost from CapEx has a value that reduces over time.
- **Operational Expenditure (OpEx)** is spending money on services or products now, and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense in the same year you spend it. There is no up-front cost, as you pay for a service or product as you use it.

## Describe the consumption-based model

- Cloud service providers operate on a consumption-based model, which means that end users only pay for the resources that they 
  use. Whatever they use is what they pay for.
  A consumption-based model has many benefits, including:
  No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest.
  No upfront costs.
  The ability to pay for additional resources when they are needed.
  The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.





# Describe the differences between categories of cloud services

## Describe the shared responsibility model

- Cloud service providers adhere to a shared security responsibility model, which means your security team maintains some    responsibilities for security as you move applications, data, containers, and workloads to the cloud, while the provider takes some responsibility, but not all.

## Describe Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)

- IaaS is the most flexible category of cloud services. It aims to give you complete control over the hardware that runs your application. Instead of buying hardware, with IaaS, you rent it.
- Azure , AWS, Oracle cloud
- The basics building bloc for cloud IT . Provides access to networking features, computers data storage scpace 
- Don't worry about the IT staff, data centers and hardware .

## Describe Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

- PaaS provides the same benefits and considerations as IaaS, but there are some additional benefits to be aware of.
- Focus on the deployment and management of your apps . Don't worry about provisionning, configuring, or understanding the hardware or the OS .
- Heroku as an example

## Describe Platform-as-a-Service SaaS

- SaaS is software that's centrally hosted and managed for you and your users or customers. Usually one version of the application is used for all customers, and it's licensed through a monthly or annual subscription.
- SaaS provides the same benefits as IaaS, but again there are some additional benefits to be aware of too.
- Gmail , Salesforce, Office 365

## What is serverless computing? 

- Serverless computing enables developers to build applications faster by eliminating the need for them to manage infrastructure. With serverless applications, the cloud service provider automatically provisions, scales and manages the infrastructure required to run the code.

# Describe the differences of between types of cloud computing 

## Define cloud computing 

- Azure compute is an on-demand computing service for running cloud-based applications. It provides computing resources such as         disks,      processors, memory, networking, and operating systems. The resources are available on-demand and can typically be made    available in   minutes or even seconds. You pay only for the resources you use, and only for as long as you're using them.
   
   Azure supports a wide range of computing solutions for development and testing, running applications, and extending your datacenter. The  service supports Linux, Windows Server, SQL Server, Oracle, IBM, and SAP. Azure also has many services that can run virtual machines (VMs) . Each service provides different options depending on your requirements. Some of the most prominent services are :
     
     - Azure Virtual Machines
     - Azure Container Instances
     - Azure App Service
     - Azure Functions (or serverless computing)


## Define Public Cloud

- Important note : A **private cloud** could be in a distant server but will be exclusively used by one organisation and thus will be private .
- Services are offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them. Cloud resources, such as servers and storage, are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider, and delivered over the internet.
- No capital expenditures to scale up.
- Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned.
- Organizations pay only for what they use.

## Define Private Cloud

- A private cloud consists of computing resources used exclusively by users from one business or organization. A private cloud can be physically located at your organization's on-site (on-premises) datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider.
- Hardware must be purchased for start-up and maintenance.
- Organizations have complete control over resources and security.
- Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates.
- 
## Hybrid Cloud

- A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that combines a public cloud and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
- Provides the most flexibility.
- Organizations determine where to run their applications.
- Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements
